            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Likewiſe the Proclamation written at large in the Certificate.</p>
            <p>Upon this Order of 20 <hi>May, Breretons</hi> Agents entered my Houſe by force, and not by his Ordinance, for he did not acquaint the Committee of Lords and Commons, nor had not their Judgement of any Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency rendring me liable to Sequeſtration, and that day &amp; other days within doores, and without, took away all my goods and perſonall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, to the value of 1600 li.</p>
            <p>So that beſides the irregularity uſed in taking away my goods for the manner of it againſt the Ordinances of Parliament will manifeſtly appeare upon reading the Cauſes thereof, in the proceedings as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
            <p>And this is certified by the Country Committee, as the whole matter whereon they have pretended the ſequeſtration of my reall eſtate, ſo that I was not ſequeſtered at all, but my eſtate irregularly and violently by them taken from me, for as they certifie their concurring in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Committee of Examinations, that Committee nor the Houſe it ſelf had no power to ſeize the eſtate or judge of the delinquency, but the Committee of Lords and Commons, both by <hi>Breretons</hi> Ordinance and the ſeverall Ordinance for ſequeſterations, declaring the Cauſes of ſequeſtration.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:204441:4"/>
            <p>The Houſe of Commons gives power to that Committee only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into, ſecure, and report, which power that Committee did exceed; for by order of that Committee, <hi>Brereton</hi> did firſt ſeize and ſecure my eſtate before any enquiry, (and guided by unſconcionable covetouſnes, was loath to let go his hold right or wrong) which was not till 9 <hi>May</hi> that I appeared, was brought thither a Priſoner, &amp; examined as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and then without hearing Counſell, or other hearing then as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; they voted me within Ordinance, my eſtate to be ſecured, till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the Houſe, and further order of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>That Committee had no power to judge of the Delinquency by that order of reference, but they do not only exceed that order, but violate their owne order of 9 <hi>May,</hi> which was not to ſequeſter or diſpoſe of my eſtate, but to ſecure it till reported to the Houſe, and further order of the Houſe; and yet by their order of 20 <hi>May,</hi> that Committee gives <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reton</hi> power to comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd for, and ſell my goods and other eſtate.</p>
            <p>By colour of which, he ſold and had away all my goods, which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent againſt his Ordinance, the order of the Houſe of Commons, and the ſetled order of the Committee if ſelfe of 9 <hi>May,</hi> and ſo it could be no ſequeſtration for my goods by the Committee of Examinations.</p>
            <p>And then the Committee of the Country for ſequeſtrations, having no other ground to warrant their pretence of ſequeſtration of my real eſtate, then the directions of the ſaid proceedings of the Committee of Examinations tranſacted unto them, as they in their Certificate expreſſe, the ſequeſtration of my real eſtate as is pretended, can be no due ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration, otherwiſe then of the perſonall eſtate, having an unjuſt riſe and ground, (the ſaid proceedings only of the Committee of Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) which is all the cauſe of ſequeſtration certified.</p>

I ſent often to the Committee to require an Inventory of my eſtate they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved according to the Ordinance, and likewiſe to demand Certificate of the ſpeciall matter of their ſo pretended ſequeſtration, to be directed to the Committee above, that ſo I might uſe my beſt indeavour for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, which they denyed me in both, and ſo delayed my proceedings to keep my eſtate ſtill in their power: and my ſon before my coming down having contracted with them for a yeer to hold the moitie of my eſtate at a Rent, for the other moitie was in extent upon a Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of 1000 li. which I did enter into long ſince to one <hi>Silverlocke,</hi> and the Committee of Lords and Commons, as by their Order may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, Ordered that in caſe the Committee did not ſatisfie him his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and Intereſt, to the diſcharge of the full debt, to permit him to take his benefit of the Recognizance upon the Lands under Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lyable thereto; whereupon Mr. <hi>Ja: Cambell</hi> and my ſon who marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. <hi>Cambels</hi> ſiſter, in <hi>May</hi> 1646. paying <hi>Silverlock</hi> 860: li. and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſome inconvenience that might fall among us upon Agreements and Covenants upon my ſons marrying, being after the time of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance entred into by me, had the Recognizance and extent by <hi>Silverlock</hi> aſſigned to them. Of this more anon.</p>
            <p>Out of my ſons agreement with them to hold the firſt moitie at a rent, with ſo much abated of the Rent as was computed a fifth part, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and he agree upon ſuch a quantitie of the ſaid Land, to keep that

            <p>Next day the 23. of <hi>Septemb.</hi> a Foot Company of Souldiers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, <hi>King</hi> hiring them, are ſent without any Officer, but brought by <hi>Latemer</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> early in the morning, pretending the Lord Generals Warrant, with Muskets ſhoot and break open the doores of my houſe before any demand, or ſhewing any Warrant, break open Chambers, rob them of money and other goods, enter my wives Chamber, affright her and her trembling daughters, (<hi>Ireland</hi> being Officer in chief for the houſe ſervice) rob the Stables of Horſes, Bridles and Saddles, and other goods; and without any reſiſtance yet lay violent hands on me, and with all diſgracefull uſage that malice could direct, carried me priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to St. <hi>Albons.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>My wife comes to St. <hi>Albons,</hi> acquaints the Committee of the wrong done her in her fifth part, could have no relief, but by procuring Bond to be given to one <hi>Hickman,</hi> that her ſon ſhould come to an account for the Rent pretended, which ſhe procures to be done: and ſo the Cattell were delivered for this time.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:204441:7"/>the Acts, and Services warranted to be done by authority of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to be indempnified, and therefore thoſe Ordinances to the end the parties authorized that they may go ſafe on in the true intention of the Ordinance, and not to be injurious to men that are not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the intention and marks plainly ſet down in the Ordinance, it is twice ſet down in the third and thirteenth Inſtruction, intituled, <hi>Inſtructions for the Committees for ſequeſtration of Delinquents eſtates, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they conceive any doubt to be guided by the directions of the Committee of Lords and Commons for that ſervice:</hi> but for Committees to act without the rule and guide of that Ordinance, do diſ-ſervice and diſ-honour to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and preſume upon the power of Committee-men, to act their own wills and malice, preſuming to be born out. And if actions are brought againſt Committee-men, it is <hi>tanta mount</hi> to an Appeale, and thoſe Committee-men have the advantage, and may complain to the proper Authority to hear and determine, and ſend for parties to attend and make their defence, which is the ſtile of that one-eared Committee of Indempnity, who are to indempnifie becauſe complained to, and have not another eare to judge upon reaſon, and indeed not power by their Ordinance to do otherwiſe, and though the Ordinance in its plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> intend not cauſes originall to this Committee, but to tryalls at Law, and upon pleading the generall iſſue, and the Ordinance for evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon a juſt and legall triall by 12. of the neighbourhood trials, will have a fair and right underſtanding, and at ſecond hand be better fitted for Indempnitie if there be cauſe, (and the Ordinance cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend but as is ſet down in cauſe of being poore) But that upon all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, Orders to flie out into all Countreys, and in all Cauſes to fetch up men to a ſlaviſh attendance, and meerly to bring griſts to the Clerks mill, who to all mens deſerning has too ſawſie an influence on his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of that Committee, even to a buſie forwardneſſe, as taking himſelf the wiſeſt man in the company, I mentioned two cauſes before as they were not proper for that Judicature for the reaſons aforeſaid; and the parties were not poore, but better able to defend the Suits then my ſelf. And I ſee a Warrant to take away the Hay of my ground, and <hi>Ireland</hi> to reſerve a third part of the moneys to bear the charges of theſe very Suits; and they have carried off my grounds 100 loads of Hay; And whiles I have been here to attend this buſineſſe (ſo inraged they are in villanies) that they have carried a great quantitie of Timber off my grounds, prepared for repairs, and all preſuming on the countenance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:204441:8"/>of that Committee, who by their Orders in the two Suits have awarded them 55 li. Coſts; And one <hi>Allen</hi> a Goldſmith, a Member of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, a fierce ſtickler, to incline the moderate of that Committee to retain the Cauſes, and make ſuch unjuſt Orders.</p>
            <p>The reaſons in chief for giving thoſe Coſt and ſuperceding proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at Law, upon both ſeverall Suits at Law thus expreſt by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee man <hi>Allen,</hi> we muſt indempnifie our ſervants. There is likewiſe one Mr. <hi>Lemman</hi> a Member, I know not whether a Committee-man of this Committee, but the promoter of theſe mens complaints to the Committee, who in ſome degree knows (if they be not birds of a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) that it is a doubtfull meaſure, or a meaſuring caſt, whether <hi>King</hi> his ignorance or inſolence lyes neereſt the Jack; But no queſtion, if weigh'd in <hi>Allens</hi> Scales, his malice would hold weight to both. And I wonder what is <hi>Lemmons</hi> reaſon, being grown a man of fortune and eſtate, and might conſider the beſt preſervative to give it continuance to his poſteritie, is the protection of the Laws, that in this caſe againſt my no other but lawfull Application to be judged by the Laws, he ſhould thus farre countenance ſuch ſheep biters, for men in the truſt of ſuch actings, and ſo well able to juſtifie themſelves againſt Suits at Law, and upon ſo great advantage as they preſume the Ordinance is to them, to ſeek ſuperfuge, at the beſt provided for a remedie for the poore, renders them no better then in the nature of ſheep biters, that hang tails between their legs upon fear of a diſcovery; ſuch ſervants beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Allens</hi> skill in his reaſon and honeſtie, to be a Judge in their cauſes. But theſe two put me in minde of an obſervation, that wiſe man Lord <hi>Egerton,</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England</hi> had upon the Laws, and tryals by Juries, that the Laws were the juſt ballaſt of doing every man right, that tryals by Juries when and where mens conſciences were bounded with fear to offend God, and not to be opened ſo large as for friendſhip, or any other ends to be exerciſed as a ſerveturn.</p>
            <p>But as tryals were moſtlie in his time carried, was, that two knaves pack in to ten fools was ſufficient to deſtroy any man that unhappily might meet with ſuch a Jury either of life, Free-hold, or whatſoever came under ſuch tryall, and in ſome caſes in all, I do verily beleeve, that both <hi>Allen</hi> and <hi>Lemmon,</hi> in their times and callings, have been Jury men, and have experienced ſomething towards truth in this matter: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet ſo eaſily go off of this Committee of Indempnitie, where I have in obedience to their Orders ſo ſlaviſhly waited, and been bitten in my
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:204441:8"/>ſelf, and in my concern now foure ſeverall times by Orders; and it ſhall be of the manner of proceeding to hear Cauſes, for the matter as <hi>Allen</hi> ſaies, they muſt indempnifie their ſervants who complain, and prove the matter complained on, and <hi>de facto</hi> prove it, for it is chiefly for being ſued at Law, this is record; and that it is ſo, is cauſe that muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnified, by the Ordinance, as they themſelves are Judges of it: ſo here is ſhort and ſure work for <hi>Allens</hi> skill in Laws, and rules in honeſty.</p>
            <p>The Committee ſit at a Table, five is a ſufficient number: the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and proofs are firſt read by <hi>Kirk</hi> the Clerk, ſay what can be ſaid in right or reaſon, but to give a ſeeming of a full hearing you muſt withdraw: A word never heard of in Courts intruſted with the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Cauſes, till this Committee; The Committee are then turned into a Jury to conſider coſts and it may be you called in to hear your doom; but howſoever you ſhall hear of it in their Order: this is all is to be expected. Whereas in Courts of upright judgement, the face of the Judge is alwayes open (without any withdraw) if in Arbitrary Courts the Judgement given in open Court, in hearing of both the parties on both ſides, and Counſell and Teſtimony of all hearers of the whole proceedings. In tryals by Juries ſometimes as there is cauſe, ſome light to Juries in point of Law is openly given by the Judge or Judges; the Verdict received and entred to be a Record <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> them in open Court ſitting. Now Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> it would better become you to refine gold, the precious jewell of your profeſſion, then to meddle with precious jewels ſo far above your underſtanding (and more precious than gold) for you to be a Judge of the deſeiſing men of their properties, the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance deſcended to me from my great Grandfather, and to him by his Mother the Heir in ſucceſſions to Anceſtors for 400 yeers. But this is gold in a Swines ſnout, and ſo I leave you.</p>
